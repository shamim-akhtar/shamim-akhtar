## [CPF Simulator](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/cpf-sim)

[![](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/cpf-sim/blob/main/images/image_02.PNG)](https://shamim-akhtar.github.io/cpf-sim/)

A responsive web-based CPF Simulator was designed to calculate projected CPF balances based on user inputs. Built using HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js. 
This CPF Simulator is created for educational purposes only and serves as a tool to help users approximate their projected CPF balances over time. The calculations used in this simulator are based on publicly available information and general assumptions about CPF contributions, interest rates, and account limits.

While this simulator aims to provide useful estimates, it is not a substitute for official CPF statements or professional financial advice. Always refer to your official CPF account or consult a financial advisor for accurate and personalized financial planning.

## [TPCraw - TemasekPoly Reddit Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw).
[![](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/blob/main/images/image_v2-2_01.PNG)](https://shamim-akhtar.github.io/tpcraw/)
TPCraw is a Python-based project that crawls posts and comments from the r/TemasekPoly subreddit and then analyzes them using Google’s Generative AI (Gemini). The project produces sentiment analyses, summaries, and visualizations (via a web-based dashboard) to gain insights into discussions about Temasek Polytechnic on Reddit.

> 
> This repository comprises the source codes for my tutorial on [**Create a Jigsaw Puzzle Game in Unity**](https://faramira.com/create-a-jigsaw-puzzle-game-in-unity/).

In this tutorial, we will go in-depth and learn how to make a jigsaw puzzle game using C sharp in Unity. We will start the tutorial with the basics of the Bézier  curve, followed by implementing Bézier  curves in Unity. We will then move on to creating jigsaw tiles from an existing image using the Bézier  curve, then generate a jigsaw board from an image and then finally create the jigsaw game in Unity.

Mazes have long been a staple in video games, offering players a challenging and immersive experience as they navigate through winding pathways and hidden corridors. And now, with Unity, you can bring these intricate mazes to life in your own projects. 
In this tutorial, we will take you through the step-by-step process of generating mazes in Unity2D, from setting up your project to implementing the backtracking algorithm for maze generation. By the end of this video, you'll have the skills and knowledge to create captivating mazes that will keep your players engaged and entertained.
