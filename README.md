<h2 align='left'>Hi there 👋 I'm Shamim 😷 Educator | 💻 Developer | 📘 Blogger | 💝 Mentor
</h2>

A highly motivated, passionate, committed and optimistic professional. During my industry days, I leveraged hands-on experience in full software development lifecycle by planning, organizing, evaluating and directing operations to manage budgets, resources and specifications. 

Now I bring the same enthusiasm, passion and commitment to help motivate, guide and mentor young students into their transition to the Industry. I try to bring a positive influence in reshaping their career for a fulfilling future. My primary objective is to communicate the right idea and show optimism. 

**The past is something that you cannot undo. The future is something that you can build.**

*I enjoy coding, developing games and writing tutorials and other articles in [Faramira](https://faramira.com/).*

<h2>I’m currently working on</h2>

> [Pathfinding for Game Development](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/unity-pathfinding).

This project implements a pathfinding framework using C# for Unity. I implemented this project primarily as a tutorial. However, you can use the core C# pathfinding classes for a wide variety of pathfinding applications.

<h2>Read my articles</h2>

> #### 1. [Create an AR app using AR Foundation in Unity](https://faramira.com/create-an-ar-app-using-ar-foundation-in-unity/)
> 
> In this tutorial, we will do the setup for our development environment and create an AR app using AR Foundation in Unity 2020.3.0f1. This tutorial will guide you on setting up the development environment required to create an AR app using AR Foundation in Unity for Android. After that, we will make our first augmented reality app using Unity to ensure that our setup is correct.

> #### 2. [Enemy Behaviour With Finite State Machine Using C# Delegates in Unity](https://faramira.com/enemy-behaviour-with-finite-state-machine-using-csharp-delegates-in-unity/)
> In this tutorial, we will implement enemy behaviour with Finite State Machine using C# delegates in Unity. 

> #### 3. [Finite State Machine Using C# Delegates in Unity](https://faramira.com/finite-state-machine-using-csharp-delegates-in-unity/)
> In this tutorial, we will implement a Finite State Machine using C# Delegates in Unity. We will then demonstrate the use of this Finite State Machine (FSM) by applying it to control an NPC enemy game object in Unity.

> #### 4. [Player Controls With Finite State Machine Using C# in Unity](https://faramira.com/implementing-player-controls-with-finite-state-machine-using-c-in-unity/)
> In this tutorial, we will implement Player Controls With Finite State Machine Using C# in Unity. We will use the Finite State Machine created in the earlier tutorial and apply it to control a player game object.

> #### 5. [Third-Person Camera Control in Unity for Android](https://faramira.com/third-person-camera-control-in-unity-for-android/)
> In this tutorial, we will port the third-person camera types to Android. This tutorial is an extension of what we have implemented in our previous tutorial. 

> #### 6. [Augmented Reality – Fire Effect using Vuforia and Unity](https://faramira.com/augmented-reality-fire-effect-using-vuforia-and-unity/)
> This tutorial covers the configuration and setup of Vuforia in Unity, the creation of an image target database and adding image targets, creating a fire particle effect,  adding the fire effect to the image target, and finally exporting the application to an Android phone.

> #### 7. [Solving 8 puzzle problem using A* star search](https://faramira.com/solving-8-puzzle-problem-using-a-star-search/)
> In this tutorial, we will solve the 8 puzzle problem using A* (star) search algorithm. We will approach the solution by first modelling the problem, then by building the fundamental blocks and finally applying a solver to solve the puzzle.

> #### 8. [Implementing a Finite State Machine Using C# in Unity](https://faramira.com/implementing-a-finite-state-machine-using-c-in-unity-part-1/)
> In this tutorial, we will learn about Finite State Machines (FSM) and implement a Finite State Machine using C# in Unity. We will then illustrate the concept by applying the implemented FSM in multiple scenarios.

> #### 9. [Implement a Splash Screen Using a Finite State Machine in Unity](https://faramira.com/implement-a-splash-screen-using-a-finite-state-machine-in-unity/)
> In this tutorial, we will implement a splash screen using a Finite State Machine in Unity. This is a continuation of the tutorial from article 8 (above). Here, we will apply the FSM that we created in article 8 into a real Unity application.

> #### 10. [How to Generate Mazes Using Depth-First Algorithm](https://faramira.com/how-to-generate-mazes-using-depth-first-algorithm/)
> In this tutorial, we will learn how to generate mazes using a depth-first algorithm. To do this firstly, I will define the problem, then I will explain the algorithm and finally demonstrate the implementation in Javascript. We will use P5js to demonstrate the working of the maze generation. View the [Maze Generation](https://editor.p5js.org/shamim/sketches/FHhb3jwST).

> #### 11. [Implementing a Command Design Pattern in Unity](https://faramira.com/implementing-a-command-design-pattern-in-unity/)
> In this tutorial, we will learn about Command Design Pattern and then implement a Command Design Pattern in Unity to solve the movement of a game object.

> #### 12. [What Are C# Delegates And How To Use Them](https://faramira.com/what-are-csharp-delegates-and-how-to-use-them/)
> C# delegates are a type that represents references to methods with a specific function signature. In short, delegates are references to methods.

> #### 13. [Solving 8 puzzle problem using A* star search in C++](https://faramira.com/solving-8-puzzle-problem-using-a-star-search-in-c/)
> In this tutorial, we will solve the 8 puzzle problem using A* (star) search algorithm. We will approach the solution by first modelling the problem, then by building the fundamental blocks and finally implement the solver in C++ to solve the puzzle.

> #### 14. [CPF Simulator to Optimize Your CPF Amounts](https://faramira.com/cpf-simulator-to-optimize-your-cpf-amounts/)
> This is a CPF Simulator that simulates the CPF accounts based on publicly available information. You can use this simulator to optimize your CPF account outputs by comparing and contrasting across multiple simulation runs.
